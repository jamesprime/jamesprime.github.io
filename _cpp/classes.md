Classes are initialised with the use of **constructors**.  Constructors must be named the same as the class name itself.

```c++
class ClassName
{
    public:
        // Constructor
        ClassName()
        {
            // Do stuff
        }
}
```

## Good practice

* Define your classes in separate files
