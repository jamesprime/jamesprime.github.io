    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>For anyone interested in the actual data produced by my computer-y faffings, please see <a href="https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/~zccah73/JC+Prime">my UCL Wiki page</a>.</p>
        <p>This space is just for documenting my adventures in research, and inevitably the issues I come up against; hopefully I'll also have some success in solving them, at which point you can expect to see said solutions appearing on here as well.</p>
