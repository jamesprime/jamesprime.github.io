### Hello!
For anyone interested in the actual data produced by my computer-y faffings, please see [my UCL Wiki page](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/~zccah73/JC+Prime).

This space is just for documenting my adventures in research, and inevitably the issues I come up against; hopefully I'll also have some success in solving them, at which point you can expect to see said solutions appearing on here as well.
